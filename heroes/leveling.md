## Experience and Levels

In Everpixel, Heroes gain experience (EXP) from dungeon runs and level up over time, becoming more powerful and profitable.

### Level System Basics

- Heroes start at **Level 1**
- Maximum level in MVP is **Level 10**
- Each level provides permanent stat improvements
- Leveling is independent of rarity and class

## Experience Gains

Heroes earn EXP from completing dungeons:

| Dungeon | Base EXP |
|---------|----------|
| Easy | 10 EXP |
| Normal | 25 EXP |
| Hard | 50 EXP |

Classes may affect EXP gains:
- **Mages** gain +20% bonus EXP
- **Warriors** and **Archers** gain standard EXP

## Experience Required Per Level

The following table shows the EXP required to reach each level:

| Level | Total EXP Required | EXP from Previous Level |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | 0 | Starting Level |
| 2 | 100 | 100 |
| 3 | 250 | 150 |
| 4 | 450 | 200 |
| 5 | 700 | 250 |
| 6 | 1,000 | 300 |
| 7 | 1,350 | 350 |
| 8 | 1,750 | 400 |
| 9 | 2,200 | 450 |
| 10 | 2,700 | 500 |

## Level Benefits

Each level provides two key benefits:

1. **+2% Coin Drop Rate per Level**
    - Increases $EPXL rewards from dungeons
    - Stacks with rarity bonuses

2. **+2% Recovery Rate per Level**
    - Improves fatigue recovery speed
    - Stacks with rarity bonuses

### Example Bonuses By Level

| Level | Coin Drop Bonus | Recovery Bonus |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | +0% | +0% |
| 2 | +2% | +2% |
| 3 | +4% | +4% |
| 5 | +8% | +8% |
| 7 | +12% | +12% |
| 10 | +18% | +18% |

## Combined Rarity and Level Bonuses

Rarity base bonuses stack with level bonuses for powerful combinations:

| Hero Type | Base + Level 10 | Total Drop Rate | Total Recovery Rate |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Common L10 | 0% + 18% | +18% | +18% |
| Rare L10 | 10% + 18% | +28% | +28% |
| Epic L10 | 20% + 18% | +38% | +38% |
| Legendary L10 | 30% + 18% | +48% | +48% |

## Accelerated Leveling

Players can spend $EPXL to accelerate the leveling process:

| Current Level | EXP Boost | Cost ($EPXL) |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1-3 | +50 EXP | 10 $EPXL |
| 4-6 | +50 EXP | 20 $EPXL |
| 7-9 | +50 EXP | 30 $EPXL |

**Important:** 100% of $EPXL spent on leveling is burned from the supply.

## Level-Up Visual Effects

When a Hero levels up:
- Special pixel animation plays
- Hero appearance subtly enhances
- Level number displayed prominently
- Stat increases are shown

## Leveling Strategy

### Optimal Leveling Approaches

| Hero Type | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Common | Natural leveling, minimal acceleration |
| Rare | Moderate acceleration to Level 5-7 |
| Epic | Accelerated leveling to Level 8+ |
| Legendary | Maximum acceleration to Level 10 ASAP |

### ROI Calculation

| Hero | Cost to L10 | Extra Daily Earnings | Days to ROI |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Common | 180 $EPXL | +1.8 $EPXL/day | 100 days |
| Rare | 180 $EPXL | +2.8 $EPXL/day | 64 days |
| Epic | 180 $EPXL | +3.8 $EPXL/day | 47 days |
| Legendary | 180 $EPXL | +4.8 $EPXL/day | 38 days |

### Leveling or New Hero?

When deciding whether to level up existing Heroes or mint new ones:

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| < 3 Heroes | Focus on minting new Heroes |
| 3-5 Heroes | Balance between minting and leveling |
| 5+ Heroes | Focus on leveling your best Heroes |
| Limited time | Level Legendary/Epic Heroes first |

Remember, higher level Heroes earn more AND have better fatigue recovery, creating a compounding benefit that makes leveling increasingly valuable over time.
