## Rarity Impact on Death Risk

Death risk varies by rarity and is further modified by dungeon difficulty:

| Rare | 3% | 3% | 4.5% | 6% |
| Epic | 2% | 2% | 3% | 4% |
| Legendary | 1% | 1% | 1.5% | 2% |

## Graveyard Staking by Rarity

When Heroes die, their rarity affects their staking power in the Graveyard:

| Rarity | Staking Multiplier | Example Daily Yield |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Common | 1x | 5 $EPXL |
| Rare | 1.5x | 7.5 $EPXL |
| Epic | 2x | 10 $EPXL |
| Legendary | 3x | 15 $EPXL |

## Rarity Visualization

Heroes' visual appearance reflects their rarity:

| Rarity | Visual Indicators |
|--------|-------------------|
| Common | Basic colors, simple design |
| Rare | Enhanced colors, added details |
| Epic | Special effects, glowing elements |
| Legendary | Animated parts, unique pixel patterns |

## Rarity Strategy

Different rarities are suited for different strategies:

| Rarity | Best Use |
|--------|----------|
| Common | Low-risk Easy dungeon runs, entry-level play |
| Rare | Balanced approach for medium-risk dungeons |
| Epic | Optimal efficiency for active players |
| Legendary | High-value targets for Hard dungeons, maximum earnings |

Each rarity has its place in a well-rounded collection. While higher rarities are obviously better, Common Heroes can be profitable too when used strategically!
