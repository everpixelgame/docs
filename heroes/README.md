## What are Heroes?

Heroes are the playable characters in Everpixel. Each Hero is a unique NFT with different attributes based on their Class and Rarity. Heroes are your main assets in the game - they fight in dungeons, earn rewards, and level up over time.

## Key Hero Features

### Minting Heroes

Heroes can be minted for **50 USDC** each. During minting:
- You randomly receive one of three Classes
- You randomly receive one of four Rarity levels
- $20 USDC from each mint is used to buy and burn $EPXL from Uniswap pool

### Classes and Rarities

Heroes come in 3 classes and 4 rarity levels:

| Class | Specialty | Attack Style |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Warrior | Melee combat | Close range |
| Mage | Magic attacks | Long range |
| Archer | Ranged combat | Medium range |

| Rarity | Drop Rate | Base Bonuses | Death Rate | Cooldown Reduction |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Common | 60% | No bonus | 5% | 2% per level |
| Rare | 25% | +10% rewards | 3% | 3% per level |
| Epic | 10% | +20% rewards | 2% | 4% per level |
| Legendary | 5% | +30% rewards | 1% | 5% per level |

### Hero Progression

Heroes gain experience from dungeons and level up over time:
- Maximum level is 10 in the MVP
- Each level adds +2% Coin Drop Rate
- Each level adds +2% Recovery Rate
- Each level reduces cooldown time by a percentage based on rarity

## Additional Rarity Benefits

As Heroes level up, they gain additional benefits based on their rarity:

- **EXP Gain**: Higher rarity Heroes gain experience faster:
    - Legendary: +15% EXP
    - Epic: +10% EXP
    - Rare: +5% EXP
    - Common: No bonus
