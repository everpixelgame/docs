## The Story of Everphaeria

Welcome to the mystical world of Everphaeria, a digital realm of pixels and adventure. This world exists on the Base Chain and serves as the setting for all your Hero adventures.

## The Great Corruption

Everphaeria was once a peaceful, thriving pixel paradise. However, a mysterious force known as The Great Corruption began to spread across the land, creating dungeons filled with monsters and warping the very nature of reality.

Heroes are now being summoned to battle this corruption, collect the magical essence ($EVER) that powers the world, and restore balance to Everphaeria.

## Key Regions

Everphaeria is divided into several distinct areas:

| Region | Danger Level | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Pixelton | Safe | The last haven for Heroes and players |
| The Wilds | Low | Home to Easy Dungeons and beginning adventures |
| Dark Valley | Medium | More dangerous area with Normal Dungeons |
| Corrupted Peak | High | Source of corruption with the most difficult dungeons |
| The Graveyard | Metaphysical | Where fallen Heroes continue to exist and contribute |
