## The World of Everpixel

Welcome to the pixel realm of **Everphaeria**, a world where magic and technology blend together in vibrant 2D landscapes. This world exists as a digital dimension on the Base Chain, where Heroes from various classes battle monsters in dangerous dungeons.

## Core Story

Long ago, the pixel realm was a peaceful place until the "Great Corruption" began spreading, creating dangerous dungeons filled with monsters. Now, Heroes must venture into these dungeons to purify them and collect the magical essence ($EPXL) that powers the realm.

## Main Locations

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Pixelton** | The central hub where Heroes gather |
| **The Wilds** | Location of the Easy Dungeons |
| **Dark Valley** | Location of the Normal Dungeons |
| **Corrupted Peak** | Location of the Hard Dungeons |
| **The Graveyard** | Where fallen Heroes rest and continue to contribute |

## Key Concepts

- **$EPXL**: The magical essence that powers the realm
- **Fatigue**: The drain on Heroes' life force when battling corruption
- **Permanent Death**: Heroes who push too hard may be lost forever
- **Graveyard**: Even in death, Heroes contribute to the realm's balance
