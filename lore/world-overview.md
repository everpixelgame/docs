## The Pixel Realm

Everphaeria is a vibrant digital dimension existing on the Base Chain. This 2D pixel world is divided into several distinct regions, each with its own characteristics and dangers.

## Regions of Everphaeria

### Pixelton (Central Hub)

Pixelton is the last safe haven in Everphaeria. This central hub is where:
- Heroes gather between adventures
- Players can access the marketplace (future feature)
- Information and quests are shared
- New Heroes are minted into existence

The town is protected by ancient pixel magic that prevents corruption from spreading within its walls.

### The Wilds (Easy Dungeons)

The forests and plains surrounding Pixelton have been mildly affected by corruption:
- Home to the easiest dungeons
- Populated by low-level pixel monsters
- Beautiful but increasingly dangerous landscape
- Best place for new Heroes to gain experience

Common enemies include Slimes, Pixel Bats, and Corrupted Bushes.

### Dark Valley (Normal Dungeons)

Beyond The Wilds lies the Dark Valley, a region heavily touched by corruption:
- Contains medium-difficulty dungeons
- Darker, more ominous pixel environments
- Higher rewards but greater danger
- Home to more powerful monsters

Common enemies include Glitch Wolves, Corruption Elementals, and Data Wraiths.

### Corrupted Peak (Hard Dungeons)

At the furthest reaches of the known world stands Corrupted Peak:
- Source of the corruption spreading through Everphaeria
- Contains the most difficult dungeons
- Twisted landscapes with unstable pixel formations
- Highest rewards and greatest risk of death

Common enemies include Void Leviathans, Corrupt Pixel Dragons, and Data Abominations.

### The Graveyard

Not exactly a physical location, but a metaphysical realm where fallen Heroes continue to exist:
- Heroes who perish are transported here
- A place between existence and deletion
- Fallen Heroes continue to generate $EVER from beyond
- Has its own eerie pixel aesthetic

## The Great Corruption

The primary conflict in Everphaeria revolves around The Great Corruption - a mysterious force that's spreading across the pixel realm:

- **Origin**: Unknown (potentially to be revealed in future updates)
- **Effects**: Creates dungeons, spawns monsters, distorts the pixel landscape
- **Purpose**: Seems to be consuming the magical essence ($EVER) of the world
- **Solution**: Heroes must enter dungeons to collect and purify $EVER
