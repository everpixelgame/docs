![New Player Guide](https://placeholder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/placeholder.png)

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Visit [everpixel.io](https://everpixel.io)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select your wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
4. Make sure you're on Base Chain

## Step 2: Get USDC and $EPXL

### For Minting Heroes (USDC):
1. You'll need USDC on Base Chain
2. Transfer USDC to your wallet or bridge from another chain
3. Each Hero costs 60 USDC to mint

### For Playing (Small amount of $EPXL):
1. Click "Buy $EPXL" in the navbar
2. Connect to the provided DEX
3. Swap USDC for $EPXL (start with at least 50 $EPXL)

## Step 3: Mint Your First Hero

1. Go to the "Heroes" section
2. Click "Mint New Hero"
3. Confirm the 60 USDC transaction
4. Wait for the transaction to complete
5. See what Hero you got!

## Step 4: Enter Your First Dungeon

1. Go to the "Dungeons" section
2. Select your newly minted Hero
3. Choose the "Easy" dungeon (costs 5 $EPXL)
4. Click "Enter Dungeon"
5. Wait for the auto-battle to complete
6. Collect your rewards!

## Step 5: Manage Your Hero

### Check Fatigue:
1. Go to "Heroes" section
2. View your Hero's fatigue meter
3. If fatigued, either wait 6 hours or restore using $EPXL

### Level Up:
1. Heroes gain EXP from dungeons automatically
2. Check progress in the Heroes section
3. When enough EXP is earned, your Hero levels up
4. Each level adds +2% to rewards and recovery rate

## Step 6: Understanding Risks

Remember these important risks:
- **Fatigue Limits**: Heroes can only run limited dungeons every 6 hours
- **Death Risk**: Each dungeon run has a chance of permanent death
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Harder dungeons = better rewards but higher death chance

## Beginner Strategy Tips
