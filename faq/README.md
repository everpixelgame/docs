# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Everpixel?
Everpixel is a 2D Pixel Art Auto-Battle game on Base Chain where you mint Heroes, send them to Dungeons, earn $EPXL tokens, and manage risks from Fatigue and Permanent Death.

### Is this a free-to-play game?
No, you need to mint at least one Hero to play, which costs 50 USDC. After that, you'll need some $EPXL tokens to enter dungeons.

### What blockchain is Everpixel on?
Everpixel runs on Base Chain, an Ethereum L2 scaling solution.

### Can I play on mobile?
Yes! Everpixel works on mobile browsers with wallet connections like MetaMask Mobile or Coinbase Wallet.

## Heroes & Minting

### How much does it cost to mint a Hero?
Minting a Hero costs 50 USDC.

### Can I choose my Hero's class and rarity?
No, both class and rarity are randomly assigned during minting.

### What are the chances of getting each rarity?
- Common: 60%
- Rare: 25%
- Epic: 10%
- Legendary: 5%

### Can I trade or sell my Heroes?
Not during the MVP phase. Trading functionality will be added in a future update.

### What happens if I get a Hero I don't want?
All Heroes are useful! Lower rarity Heroes still earn rewards and can be strategically valuable. In the future, you'll be able to merge or trade unwanted Heroes.

## Gameplay

### How do battles work?
Battles are automatic - your Hero's stats and abilities determine the outcome. You don't need to actively participate in the combat.

### How does the cooldown system work?
All Heroes start with a 6-hour cooldown at Level 1. As they level up, this cooldown decreases by a percentage based on their rarity:
- Common: 2% reduction per level
- Rare: 3% reduction per level
- Epic: 4% reduction per level
- Legendary: 5% reduction per level

For example, a Level 10 Legendary Hero will have a 3.3-hour cooldown (45% reduction from 6 hours).

### What happens when my Hero dies?
Death is permanent! Your Hero will be moved to the Graveyard, where they become a staker earning passive $EPXL rewards.

### How can I prevent my Hero from dying?
You can't eliminate death risk completely, but you can reduce it by:
- Using higher rarity Heroes (lower base death rate)
- Running easier dungeons (lower difficulty multiplier)
- Leveling up your Heroes (better performance)

## Tokens & Economy

### What is $EPXL used for?
$EPXL is used for dungeon entry, fatigue recovery, and future features like cosmetics and trading fees.

### How do I earn $EPXL?
You can earn $EPXL from:
- Dungeon rewards

### Where can I buy $EPXL?
$EPXL can be purchased on DEXes like Uniswap on Base Chain.

### Is there a limit to the $EPXL supply?

### What prevents $EPXL from crashing in value?
The game includes several economic controls:
- Aggressive burn mechanisms (95-100% of fees)
- Locked rewards that unlock gradually
- Buy & burn from Hero minting
- Utility value across multiple game systems

## Technical Questions

### Are the smart contracts audited?
