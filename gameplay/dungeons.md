# Dungeon System

## How Dungeons Work

Dungeons are automated battle arenas where your Heroes fight enemies to earn $EPXL rewards. You select a Hero and a dungeon, pay the entry fee, and the battle plays out automatically.

## Dungeon Types

Everpixel features three dungeon types, each with different difficulty levels:

| Dungeon | Entry Fee | Rewards | Death Chance | Risk/Reward Ratio |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Easy | 5 $EPXL | 10 $EPXL | Base | 2x (100% ROI) |
| Normal | 15 $EPXL | 35 $EPXL | Base x1.5 | 2.33x (133% ROI) |
| Hard | 30 $EPXL | 75 $EPXL | Base x2 | 2.5x (150% ROI) |

> **Note:** Base death chance depends on your Hero's rarity. The dungeon multiplies this chance.

## Reward System

Rewards are calculated based on:
1. Dungeon difficulty (reward amount)
2. Hero's rarity (base drop bonus)
3. Hero's level (+2% per level)

For example:
- Level 1 Common Hero in Easy Dungeon = 10 $EPXL
- Level 5 Rare Hero in Normal Dungeon = 35 Ã— (1 + 0.1 + 0.08) = 41.3 $EPXL

## Dungeon Battle Process

1. **Select Hero** - Choose which Hero to send
2. **Choose Dungeon** - Select difficulty level
3. **Pay Entry Fee** - 75% of the fee is burned, 5% goes to treasury, 20% goes to Graveyard staking pool
4. **Auto-Battle** - The system automatically resolves the battle
5. **Receive Rewards** - Get locked $EPXL tokens (unlocked gradually)
6. **Check Results** - Your Hero gains EXP and may suffer fatigue or death

## Death Risk

Each dungeon run has a chance of causing permanent death:

| Hero Rarity | Base Death Rate | Easy Dungeon | Normal Dungeon | Hard Dungeon |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Common | 5% | 5% | 7.5% | 10% |
| Rare | 3% | 3% | 4.5% | 6% |
| Epic | 2% | 2% | 3% | 4% |
| Legendary | 1% | 1% | 1.5% | 2% |

## Strategic Considerations

- **Risk vs. Reward**: Higher difficulty dungeons offer significantly better rewards but increase death risk
- **Hero Selection**: Consider using higher rarity Heroes for harder dungeons
- **Fatigue Management**: Make sure your Hero isn't too fatigued before a run
- **Level Advantage**: Higher level Heroes earn more rewards from the same dungeons
