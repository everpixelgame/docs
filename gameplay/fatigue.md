# Fatigue System

![Fatigue Meter](https://placeholder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/placeholder.png)

## What is Fatigue?

Fatigue represents your Hero's energy and stamina. Each time a Hero enters a dungeon, they use energy and become more fatigued. Heroes with too much fatigue can't enter dungeons until they recover.

## Fatigue Cooldown

All Heroes start with the same base cooldown of 6 hours at Level 1, which decreases as your Hero levels up. Higher rarity Heroes receive greater cooldown reductions per level.

### Cooldown Reduction Per Level by Rarity

| Rarity | Cooldown Reduction per Level |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Common | 2% per level |
| Rare | 3% per level |
| Epic | 4% per level |
| Legendary | 5% per level |

### Cooldown Duration Table

| Level | Common | Rare | Epic | Legendary |
|-------|--------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | 6 hours | 6 hours | 6 hours | 6 hours |
| 2 | 5.88 hours | 5.82 hours | 5.76 hours | 5.7 hours |
| 3 | 5.76 hours | 5.64 hours | 5.52 hours | 5.4 hours |
| 4 | 5.64 hours | 5.46 hours | 5.28 hours | 5.1 hours |
| 5 | 5.52 hours | 5.28 hours | 5.04 hours | 4.8 hours |
| 6 | 5.40 hours | 5.10 hours | 4.8 hours | 4.5 hours |
| 7 | 5.28 hours | 4.92 hours | 4.56 hours | 4.2 hours |
| 8 | 5.16 hours | 4.74 hours | 4.32 hours | 3.9 hours |
| 9 | 5.04 hours | 4.56 hours | 4.08 hours | 3.6 hours |
| 10 | 4.92 hours | 4.38 hours | 3.84 hours | 3.3 hours |

Once a Hero reaches their fatigue limit, they can't enter dungeons until:
1. The cooldown period passes, OR
2. You restore their energy using $EPXL

## Daily Dungeon Runs

The number of dungeon runs a Hero can make in 24 hours varies by level and rarity:

| Level | Common | Rare | Epic | Legendary |
|-------|--------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | 4 runs | 4 runs | 4 runs | 4 runs |
| 5 | 4.35 runs | 4.55 runs | 4.76 runs | 5 runs |
| 10 | 4.88 runs | 5.48 runs | 6.25 runs | 7.27 runs |

## Restoring Fatigue

You can instantly restore fatigue by spending $EPXL. The cost is calculated based on the Hero's level and rarity.

The formula takes into account:
- Hero's rarity (higher rarity = higher cost)
- Hero's level (higher level = higher cost)

**Important:** 100% of $EPXL spent on fatigue restoration is burned from the supply.

## Fatigue Recovery Bonuses

Heroes with higher rarity and level recover fatigue faster:

- **Base Recovery Rate**: Determined by rarity
  - Common: 0% bonus
  - Rare: +10% bonus
  - Epic: +20% bonus
  - Legendary: +30% bonus

- **Level Bonus**: +2% recovery rate per level

For example, a Level 5 Epic Hero would have:
- Base recovery: +20% (Epic rarity)
- Level bonus: +10% (Level 5 Ã— 2%)
- Total: +30% faster recovery

## Risk-Reward Balance

To maintain game economy balance, additional mechanics are in place:

1. **Progressive Risk**: As you use the same Hero multiple times in a single day, the death risk increases slightly:
  - Runs 1-3: Normal death chance
  - Runs 4-6: +1% death chance
  - Runs 7+: +2% death chance

2. **Progressive Reward Lock**: Rewards from multiple runs in a day are locked for longer periods:
  - Runs 1-3: Standard unlock period (24 hours)
  - Runs 4-6: Extended unlock period (48 hours)
  - Runs 7+: Long unlock period (72 hours)

## Strategic Fatigue Management

- **Plan your dungeon runs** around the cooldown period
- **Balance risk and reward** with multiple daily runs
- **Consider the cost** of fatigue restoration versus potential rewards
- **Level up your Heroes** to improve recovery rates
- **Create a diverse roster** with Heroes of different rarities for optimal play
