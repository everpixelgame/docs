# Fatigue System

![Fatigue Meter](https://placeholder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/placeholder.png)

## What is Fatigue?

Fatigue represents your Hero's energy and stamina. Each time a Hero enters a dungeon, they use energy and become more fatigued. Heroes with too much fatigue can't enter dungeons until they recover.

## Fatigue Limits

Each Hero has a maximum number of dungeon runs they can perform every 6 hours:

| Rarity | Dungeon Runs (per 6 hours) |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Common | 1 |
| Rare | 2 |
| Epic | 3 |
| Legendary | 5 |

Once a Hero reaches their fatigue limit, they can't enter dungeons until:
1. The 6-hour cooldown period passes, OR
2. You restore their energy using $EPXL

## Restoring Fatigue

You can instantly restore fatigue by spending $EPXL:

| Restore Count (Today) | Cost |
|-----------------------|------|
| 1st restore | 5 $EPXL |
| 2nd restore | 8 $EPXL |
| 3rd restore | 12 $EPXL |
| 4th restore | 16 $EPXL |
| 5th+ restore | 20 $EPXL |

**Important:** 100% of $EPXL spent on fatigue restoration is burned from the supply.

## Fatigue Recovery Bonuses

Heroes with higher rarity and level recover fatigue faster:

- **Base Recovery Rate**: Determined by rarity
    - Common: 0% bonus
    - Rare: +10% bonus
    - Epic: +20% bonus
    - Legendary: +30% bonus

- **Level Bonus**: +2% recovery rate per level

For example, a Level 5 Epic Hero would have:
- Base recovery: +20% (Epic rarity)
- Level bonus: +10% (Level 5 Ã— 2%)
- Total: +30% faster recovery

## Strategic Fatigue Management

- **Plan your dungeon runs** around the 6-hour cooldown
- **Use higher rarity Heroes** for more frequent dungeon runs
- **Consider the cost** of fatigue restoration versus potential rewards
- **Level up your Heroes** to improve their recovery rates
- **Balance your roster** with Heroes of different rarities for optimal play
