# Fatigue System

## What is Fatigue?

Fatigue represents your Hero's energy and stamina. Each time a Hero enters a dungeon, they use energy and become more fatigued. Heroes with too much fatigue can't enter dungeons until they recover.

## Fatigue Cooldown

Each Hero has a cooldown period after dungeon runs:

| Rarity | Cooldown Hours |
|--------|----------------|
| Common | 6 hours |
| Rare | 3 hours |
| Epic | 2 hours |
| Legendary | 1 hour |

Once a Hero reaches their fatigue limit, they can't enter dungeons until:
1. The cooldown period passes, OR
2. You restore their energy using $EPXL

## Restoring Fatigue

You can instantly restore fatigue by spending $EPXL. The cost is calculated based on the Hero's level and rarity.

The formula takes into account:
- Hero's rarity (higher rarity = higher cost)
- Hero's level (higher level = higher cost)

**Important:** 100% of $EPXL spent on fatigue restoration is burned from the supply.

## Fatigue Recovery Bonuses

Heroes with higher rarity and level recover fatigue faster:

- **Base Recovery Rate**: Determined by rarity
  - Common: 0% bonus
  - Rare: +10% bonus
  - Epic: +20% bonus
  - Legendary: +30% bonus

- **Level Bonus**: +2% recovery rate per level

For example, a Level 5 Epic Hero would have:
- Base recovery: +20% (Epic rarity)
- Level bonus: +10% (Level 5 Ã— 2%)
- Total: +30% faster recovery

## Strategic Fatigue Management

- **Plan your dungeon runs** around the cooldown period
- **Use higher rarity Heroes** for more frequent dungeon runs
- **Consider the cost** of fatigue restoration versus potential rewards
- **Level up your Heroes** to improve their recovery rates
- **Balance your roster** with Heroes of different rarities for optimal play
