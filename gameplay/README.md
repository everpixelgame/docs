## How Everpixel Works

The core gameplay loop in Everpixel is simple but strategic:

1. **Mint Heroes** - Get unique characters with different classes and rarities
2. **Enter Dungeons** - Send your Heroes to battle automatically
3. **Earn Rewards** - Collect $EVER tokens from successful dungeon runs
4. **Manage Fatigue** - Wait for your Heroes to recover naturally over time
5. **Level Up** - Improve your Heroes' abilities over time
6. **Handle Death** - When Heroes die, they become stakers in the Graveyard

## Key Game Systems

### 1. Dungeon System

Dungeons are where your Heroes battle enemies and earn rewards:
- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard
- Each requires different amounts of $EVER to enter
- Higher difficulties offer better rewards but increased death risk
- Rewards are given in $EVER tokens
- Dungeon fees distribution: 75% burned, 5% to treasury, 20% to Graveyard staking pool

### 2. Fatigue System

Heroes get tired after dungeon runs:
- All Heroes start with a 6-hour cooldown at Level 1
- Cooldown decreases as Heroes level up, with higher rarity Heroes gaining larger reductions:
  - Common: 2% reduction per level
  - Rare: 3% reduction per level
  - Epic: 4% reduction per level
  - Legendary: 5% reduction per level
- Heroes must wait for their cooldown timer to complete before entering another dungeon

### 3. Death & Graveyard System

Heroes can die permanently in dungeons:
- Death chances vary by rarity (Common: 5%, Rare: 3%, Epic: 2%, Legendary: 1%)
- Dead Heroes enter the Graveyard (no revival)
- Graveyard Heroes become "Stakers" earning $EVER rewards from a pool that receives 20% of all dungeon entry fees
- Reward distribution is based on staking power determined by Hero rarity and the difficulty of the dungeon where they died

### 4. Premium Features

Optional enhancements available for purchase with $EVER:
- **Experience Accelerators**: Speed up Hero leveling
- **Death Protection Shields**: Prevent permanent death for a single dungeon run

## System Connections

These systems all connect to create a balanced economy:
- Dungeon rewards provide the main $EVER income
- Dungeon entry fees create multiple economic flows:
  - 75% burned (deflation mechanism)
  - 5% to treasury (development funding)
  - 20% to Graveyard pool (passive income system)
- Death risk creates strategic choices about which Heroes to use
- The Graveyard ensures even dead Heroes retain value as stakers in the reward pool
- Leveling provides gradual cooldown reduction based on rarity, creating long-term value
- Premium Features offer strategic advantages while maintaining economic balance
