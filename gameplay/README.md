## How Everpixel Works

The core gameplay loop in Everpixel is simple but strategic:

1. **Mint Heroes** - Get unique characters with different classes and rarities
2. **Enter Dungeons** - Send your Heroes to battle automatically
3. **Earn Rewards** - Collect $EPXL tokens from successful dungeon runs
4. **Manage Fatigue** - Wait for your Heroes to recover or restore energy with $EPXL
5. **Level Up** - Improve your Heroes' abilities over time
6. **Handle Death** - When Heroes die, they become stakers in the Graveyard

## Key Game Systems

### 1. Dungeon System

Dungeons are where your Heroes battle enemies and earn rewards:
- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard
- Each requires different amounts of $EPXL to enter
- Higher difficulties offer better rewards but increased death risk
- Rewards are given in $EPXL tokens

### 2. Fatigue System

Heroes get tired after dungeon runs:
- Each Hero has a cooldown period based on rarity (Common: 6h, Rare: 3h, Epic: 2h, Legendary: 1h)
- Restore fatigue by spending $EPXL
- Cost is based on Hero's level and rarity

### 3. Death & Graveyard System

Heroes can die permanently in dungeons:
- Death chances vary by rarity (Common: 5%, Rare: 3%, Epic: 2%, Legendary: 1%)
- Dead Heroes enter the Graveyard (no revival)
- Graveyard Heroes become "Stakers" earning $EPXL rewards from a pool that receives 20% of all spent $EPXL
- Reward factors: Hero rarity, dungeon difficulty at death, time in Graveyard

## System Connections

These systems all connect to create a balanced economy:
- Dungeon rewards provide the main $EPXL income
- Fatigue and dungeon entry fees create $EPXL burning mechanisms
- Death risk creates strategic choices about which Heroes to use
- The Graveyard ensures even dead Heroes retain value
