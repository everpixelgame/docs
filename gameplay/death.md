# Death & Graveyard System

## Permanent Death

In Everpixel, death is permanent. When a Hero dies, they cannot be revived and will be moved to the Graveyard. This creates meaningful risk/reward decisions in how you use your Heroes.

## Death Chance

Each Hero has a base death chance determined by their rarity:

| Rarity | Base Death Chance |
|--------|-------------------|
| Common | 5% |
| Rare | 3% |
| Epic | 2% |
| Legendary | 1% |

This chance is modified by dungeon difficulty:
- **Easy Dungeon**: Base chance
- **Normal Dungeon**: Base chance × 1.5
- **Hard Dungeon**: Base chance × 2

For example, a Common Hero in a Hard Dungeon has a 10% chance of death (5% × 2).

## The Graveyard System

When Heroes die, they're not completely useless! They enter the Graveyard and become "Stakers."

### How Graveyard Staking Works

1. Dead Heroes earn random $EPXL rewards every X blocks
2. Rewards are based on:
    - **Hero Rarity**: Higher rarity = better rewards
    - **Dungeon Difficulty**: Heroes that died in harder dungeons earn more
    - **Time in Graveyard**: Longer staking = improved rewards

### Graveyard Rewards Formula

Basic reward formula: `Base Rate × Rarity Multiplier × Difficulty Multiplier × Time Multiplier`

| Factor | Multiplier |
|--------|------------|
| **Rarity** |  |
| Common | 1x |
| Rare | 1.5x |
| Epic | 2x |
| Legendary | 3x |
| **Difficulty** |  |
| Easy | 1x |
| Normal | 1.5x |
| Hard | 2x |
| **Time** |  |
| 1 day | 1x |
| 1 week | 1.2x |
| 1 month | 1.5x |
| 3+ months | 2x |

## Strategic Considerations

- **Risk Assessment**: Balance reward potential against death risk
- **Hero Value**: Consider if a Hero is worth risking in a harder dungeon
- **Graveyard Value**: Sometimes it's strategic to send Heroes to the Graveyard for long-term staking
- **Portfolio Balance**: Maintain a mix of living Heroes and Graveyard stakers

## Graveyard Dashboard
