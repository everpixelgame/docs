## $EVER Premium Utilities

Beyond the core functionality of entering dungeons, $EVER can now be used to purchase special bonuses and enhancements for your Heroes. These premium features add strategic depth to the game while providing additional utility for the $EVER token.

## Available Premium Features

### Experience Accelerator

Speed up your Hero's experience gain for a single dungeon run.

| Accelerator | Cost | Effect | Application |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Quick Learner | 15 $EVER | +25% EXP gained | Single dungeon run |
| Scholar | 35 $EVER | +50% EXP gained | Single dungeon run |
| Master | 60 $EVER | +100% EXP gained | Single dungeon run |

**Burn Rate**: 85% of $EVER spent on Experience Accelerators is burned, with 15% going to the Treasury.

#### EXP Accelerator Calculation Examples

**Example 1:** Common Hero with Quick Learner in Easy Dungeon
- Base EXP: 10 EXP
- Accelerator Effect: +25% EXP
- Final EXP: 10 × 1.25 = 12.5 EXP
- Cost: 15 $EVER (12.75 $EVER burned, 2.25 $EVER to Treasury)

**Example 2:** Rare Hero with Scholar in Normal Dungeon
- Base EXP: 25 × 1.05 = 26.25 EXP (includes Rare bonus)
- Accelerator Effect: +50% EXP
- Final EXP: 26.25 × 1.5 = 39.375 EXP
- Additional EXP Gained: 39.375 - 26.25 = 13.125 EXP
- Cost: 35 $EVER (29.75 $EVER burned, 5.25 $EVER to Treasury)

**Example 3:** Legendary Hero with Master in Hard Dungeon
- Base EXP: 50 × 1.15 = 57.5 EXP (includes Legendary bonus)
- Accelerator Effect: +100% EXP
- Final EXP: 57.5 × 2 = 115 EXP
- Additional EXP Gained: 115 - 57.5 = 57.5 EXP
- Cost: 60 $EVER (51 $EVER burned, 9 $EVER to Treasury)

### Pixel Shield

Purchase protection against permanent death for your Hero during a single dungeon run.

| Shield Type | Cost | Effect | Application |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Pixel Shield | 40 $EVER | Prevents death with 100% chance | Single dungeon run |

**Burn Rate**: 80% of $EVER spent on Pixel Shield is burned, with 20% going to the Treasury.

#### Pixel Shield Calculation Examples

**Example 1:** Common Hero with Pixel Shield in Hard Dungeon
- Normal Death Risk: 5% × 2 = 10%
- With Shield: Death prevented 100% for this run
- Value Saved: Potentially a Hero worth 50 USDC
- Cost: 40 $EVER (32 $EVER burned, 8 $EVER to Treasury)

**Example 2:** Epic Hero with Pixel Shield in Normal Dungeon
- Normal Death Risk: 2% × 1.5 = 3%
- With Shield: Death prevented 100% for this run
- Value Protected: Epic Hero worth 50 USDC
- Cost: 40 $EVER (32 $EVER burned, 8 $EVER to Treasury)

**Example 3:** Legendary Hero with Pixel Shield in Hard Dungeon
- Normal Death Risk: 1% × 2 = 2%
- With Shield: Death prevented 100% for this run
- Value Protected: Legendary Hero worth 50 USDC
- Cost: 40 $EVER (32 $EVER burned, 8 $EVER to Treasury)

## How to Use Premium Features

1. **Select Your Hero** for the dungeon run
2. **Choose Your Dungeon** difficulty
3. **Select Premium Features** before confirming the dungeon entry
4. **Confirm and Pay** the combined cost (dungeon entry fee + premium features)
5. **Enter the Dungeon** with your enhanced Hero

Premium features must be purchased before each dungeon run and apply only to that specific run. You need to repurchase features for each subsequent dungeon run.

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Use Experience Accelerators
- Most efficient when used with Hard Dungeons for maximum EXP gain
- Ideal for Heroes approaching their next level milestone
- Cost-effective for Legendary and Epic Heroes due to their inherent EXP bonuses

### When to Use Pixel Shield
- Essential when sending valuable Heroes into Hard Dungeons
- Particularly important for Legendary Heroes with significant investment
- Most cost-effective when protecting high-level or high-rarity Heroes
- Recommended for Heroes nearing level-up milestones

#### Strategic Decision Examples

**Example 1:** Level 9 Legendary Hero close to Level 10
- Hero Value: Very high (near maximum level, lowest cooldown)
- Dungeon: Hard Dungeon for fastest EXP
- Risk: 2% death chance
- Recommended Strategy: Pixel Shield (40 $EVER) + Master Accelerator (60 $EVER)
- Rationale: The combined cost of 100 $EVER is justified by protecting a nearly maxed Legendary Hero and significantly accelerating the final level gains

**Example 2:** Common Hero Level 3
- Hero Value: Low
- Purpose: Basic gameplay
- Recommended Strategy: No premium features
- Rationale: The value of the Hero doesn't justify premium costs; better to save $EVER

## Economy Impact

The introduction of Premium Features creates additional $EVER utility while maintaining economic balance through high burn rates:

- **Token Utility**: Creates more demand for $EVER beyond basic game functions
- **Controlled Inflation**: High burn rates (80-85%) ensure these features don't disrupt the economy
- **Strategic Depth**: Offers players more strategic choices and risk management options
- **Treasury Support**: Contributes 15-20% of feature costs to ongoing game development

### Economic Impact Examples

**Example 1:** Player using Premium Features on 10% of dungeon runs
- Average Premium Cost: ~30 $EVER per enhanced run
- Average Burn Rate: ~82.5%
- $EVER Burned per Enhanced Run: ~24.75 $EVER
- Treasury Contribution per Enhanced Run: ~5.25 $EVER

**Example 2:** Game-wide economic impact with 1,000 active players
- Assume average 5 dungeon runs per player daily
- Assume 20% of runs use premium features
- Total Premium Feature Runs: 1,000 players × 5 runs × 20% = 1,000 enhanced runs daily
- Assume average 30 $EVER spent on premium features per enhanced run
- Total Premium Feature Spending: 30,000 $EVER daily
- Total Burned: ~24,750 $EVER daily
- Total to Treasury: ~5,250 $EVER daily

## Future Premium Features

The development team is exploring additional premium features for future updates, potentially including:

- **Cooldown Reducers**: Decrease a Hero's cooldown time for a single recovery
- **Hero Appearance Customization**: Cosmetic enhancements for your Heroes
