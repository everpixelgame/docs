## $EPXL Premium Utilities

Beyond the core functionality of entering dungeons and recovering fatigue, $EPXL can now be used to purchase special bonuses and enhancements for your Heroes. These premium features add strategic depth to the game while providing additional utility for the $EPXL token.

## Available Premium Features

### Rare Item Drop Boost

Increase your Hero's chance of finding rare items during a single dungeon run without affecting $EPXL rewards.

| Boost Level | Cost | Effect | Application |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Minor Boost | 8 $EPXL | +10% rare item drop chance | Single dungeon run |
| Medium Boost | 20 $EPXL | +25% rare item drop chance | Single dungeon run |
| Major Boost | 45 $EPXL | +50% rare item drop chance | Single dungeon run |

**Burn Rate**: 90% of $EPXL spent on Rare Item Drop Boosts is burned, with 10% going to the Treasury.

#### Drop Boost Calculation Examples

**Example 1:** Common Hero with Minor Boost
- Base Drop Rate: Let's say 5% for rare items
- Boost Effect: +10% chance
- Final Drop Rate: 5% + 10% = 15% chance
- Cost: 8 $EPXL (7.2 $EPXL burned, 0.8 $EPXL to Treasury)

**Example 2:** Legendary Hero with Major Boost
- Base Drop Rate: Let's say 15% for rare items
- Boost Effect: +50% chance
- Final Drop Rate: 15% + 50% = 65% chance
- Cost: 45 $EPXL (40.5 $EPXL burned, 4.5 $EPXL to Treasury)

**Example 3:** Epic Hero running Normal Dungeon with Medium Boost
- Base Reward: 25 $EPXL (unchanged by boost)
- Item Drop Chance: +25% for rare items
- Total Cost: 20 $EPXL + 15 $EPXL (dungeon entry) = 35 $EPXL
- Potential Value: Normal reward (25 $EPXL) + chance of valuable rare items

### Experience Accelerator

Speed up your Hero's experience gain for a single dungeon run.

| Accelerator | Cost | Effect | Application |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Quick Learner | 15 $EPXL | +25% EXP gained | Single dungeon run |
| Scholar | 35 $EPXL | +50% EXP gained | Single dungeon run |
| Master | 60 $EPXL | +100% EXP gained | Single dungeon run |

**Burn Rate**: 85% of $EPXL spent on Experience Accelerators is burned, with 15% going to the Treasury.

#### EXP Accelerator Calculation Examples

**Example 1:** Common Hero with Quick Learner in Easy Dungeon
- Base EXP: 10 EXP
- Accelerator Effect: +25% EXP
- Final EXP: 10 × 1.25 = 12.5 EXP
- Cost: 15 $EPXL (12.75 $EPXL burned, 2.25 $EPXL to Treasury)

**Example 2:** Rare Hero with Scholar in Normal Dungeon
- Base EXP: 25 × 1.05 = 26.25 EXP (includes Rare bonus)
- Accelerator Effect: +50% EXP
- Final EXP: 26.25 × 1.5 = 39.375 EXP
- Additional EXP Gained: 39.375 - 26.25 = 13.125 EXP
- Cost: 35 $EPXL (29.75 $EPXL burned, 5.25 $EPXL to Treasury)

**Example 3:** Legendary Hero with Master in Hard Dungeon
- Base EXP: 50 × 1.15 = 57.5 EXP (includes Legendary bonus)
- Accelerator Effect: +100% EXP
- Final EXP: 57.5 × 2 = 115 EXP
- Additional EXP Gained: 115 - 57.5 = 57.5 EXP
- Cost: 60 $EPXL (51 $EPXL burned, 9 $EPXL to Treasury)

### Death Protection Shield

Purchase insurance against permanent death for your Hero during a single dungeon run.

| Shield Type | Cost | Effect | Application |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Basic Shield | 25 $EPXL | Prevents death with 100% chance | Single dungeon run |
| Advanced Shield | 40 $EPXL | Prevents death with 100% chance and returns 10 $EPXL if not triggered | Single dungeon run |
| Ultimate Shield | 75 $EPXL | Prevents death with 100% chance and returns 25 $EPXL if not triggered | Single dungeon run |

**Burn Rate**: 80% of $EPXL spent on Death Protection Shields is burned, with 20% going to the Treasury.

#### Death Protection Calculation Examples

**Example 1:** Common Hero with Basic Shield in Hard Dungeon
- Normal Death Risk: 5% × 2 = 10%
- With Shield: Death prevented 100% for this run
- Value Saved: Potentially a Hero worth 50 USDC
- Cost: 25 $EPXL (20 $EPXL burned, 5 $EPXL to Treasury)

**Example 2:** Epic Hero with Advanced Shield in Normal Dungeon
- Normal Death Risk: 2% × 1.5 = 3%
- With Shield: Death prevented 100% for this run
- If Hero survives naturally (97% chance): 10 $EPXL returned
- Expected Return: 0.97 × 10 = 9.7 $EPXL
- Net Average Cost: 40 - 9.7 = 30.3 $EPXL

**Example 3:** Legendary Hero with Ultimate Shield in Hard Dungeon
- Normal Death Risk: 1% × 2 = 2%
- With Shield: Death prevented 100% for this run
- If Hero survives naturally (98% chance): 25 $EPXL returned
- Expected Return: 0.98 × 25 = 24.5 $EPXL
- Net Average Cost: 75 - 24.5 = 50.5 $EPXL

## How to Use Premium Features

1. **Select Your Hero** for the dungeon run
2. **Choose Your Dungeon** difficulty
3. **Select Premium Features** before confirming the dungeon entry
4. **Confirm and Pay** the combined cost (dungeon entry fee + premium features)
5. **Enter the Dungeon** with your enhanced Hero

Premium features must be purchased before each dungeon run and apply only to that specific run. You need to repurchase features for each subsequent dungeon run.

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Use Rare Item Drop Boosts
- Best used in Hard Dungeons where rare items are more common
- Particularly valuable for high-level Heroes with low death risk
- Consider activating when hunting for specific rare items

### When to Use Experience Accelerators
- Most efficient when used with Hard Dungeons for maximum EXP gain
- Ideal for Heroes approaching their next level milestone
- Cost-effective for Legendary and Epic Heroes due to their inherent EXP bonuses

### When to Use Death Protection Shields
- Essential when sending valuable Heroes into Hard Dungeons
- Particularly important for Legendary Heroes with significant investment
- Advanced and Ultimate shields provide refunds if not triggered, reducing the average cost

#### Strategic Decision Examples

**Example 1:** Level 9 Legendary Hero close to Level 10
- Hero Value: Very high (near maximum level, lowest cooldown)
- Dungeon: Hard Dungeon for fastest EXP
- Risk: 2% death chance
- Recommended Strategy: Ultimate Shield (75 $EPXL) + Master Accelerator (60 $EPXL)
- Rationale: The combined cost of 135 $EPXL is justified by protecting a nearly maxed Legendary Hero and significantly accelerating the final level gains

**Example 2:** New Rare Hero for item farming
- Hero Value: Moderate
- Purpose: Collecting rare items
- Recommended Strategy: Medium Boost (20 $EPXL) in Normal Dungeons
- Rationale: Balances cost with item drop chance improvement, while keeping death risk at manageable 4.5%

**Example 3:** Common Hero Level 3
- Hero Value: Low
- Purpose: Basic gameplay
- Recommended Strategy: No premium features
- Rationale: The value of the Hero doesn't justify premium costs; better to save $EPXL

## Economy Impact

The introduction of Premium Features creates additional $EPXL utility while maintaining economic balance through high burn rates:

- **Token Utility**: Creates more demand for $EPXL beyond basic game functions
- **Controlled Inflation**: High burn rates (80-90%) ensure these features don't disrupt the economy
- **Strategic Depth**: Offers players more strategic choices and risk management options
- **Treasury Support**: Contributes 10-20% of feature costs to ongoing game development

### Economic Impact Examples

**Example 1:** Player using Premium Features on 10% of dungeon runs
- Average Premium Cost: ~30 $EPXL per enhanced run
- Average Burn Rate: ~85%
- $EPXL Burned per Enhanced Run: ~25.5 $EPXL
- Treasury Contribution per Enhanced Run: ~4.5 $EPXL

**Example 2:** Game-wide economic impact with 1,000 active players
- Assume average 5 dungeon runs per player daily
- Assume 20% of runs use premium features
- Total Premium Feature Runs: 1,000 players × 5 runs × 20% = 1,000 enhanced runs daily
- Assume average 30 $EPXL spent on premium features per enhanced run
- Total Premium Feature Spending: 30,000 $EPXL daily
- Total Burned: ~25,500 $EPXL daily
- Total to Treasury: ~4,500 $EPXL daily
