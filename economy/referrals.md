## How Referrals Work

The Everpixel referral system allows players to earn rewards by inviting friends to the game. It's a simple way to grow the community while earning passive income.

## Referral Process

1. **Get Your Referral Link/Code**: Each player has a unique referral ID
2. **Share with Friends**: Send your link to friends through social media, messaging, etc.
3. **Friends Join**: When they start playing, they enter your referral code
4. **Earn Rewards**: You receive 3% of all the $EPXL your referred friends spend in-game

## Technical Implementation

The referral system is implemented directly on-chain:
- Smart contract maintains a mapping of `user â†’ referrer`
- Once set, this relationship is permanent
- Rewards are calculated automatically when referred players spend $EPXL
- Referral rewards can be claimed from your Dashboard

## Reward Calculation Example

| Friend's Action | $EPXL Spent | Your Reward (3%) |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Enters Easy Dungeon | 5 $EPXL | 0.15 $EPXL |
| Recovers Fatigue | 10 $EPXL | 0.3 $EPXL |
| Enters Hard Dungeon | 30 $EPXL | 0.9 $EPXL |
| **Monthly Total** | **1,000 $EPXL** | **30 $EPXL** |

## Referral Dashboard

The Referral Dashboard shows:
- Number of active referrals
- Total $EPXL earned from referrals
- Breakdown by referred user
- Claimable rewards

## Referral Tips

1. **Target the Right Audience**: Share with friends interested in crypto gaming
2. **Explain the Game**: Help new players understand how to start
3. **Stay Active**: Engaged referrals spend more, earning you more rewards
4. **Create Content**: Tutorials and guides can attract more referrals
5. **Community Building**: Create or join communities focused on the game

## Compound Effect

The more active players you refer, the more your passive income grows:

| Number of Active Referrals | Average Monthly Spend | Your Monthly Income |
|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 5 | 1,000 $EPXL | 150 $EPXL |
| 10 | 1,000 $EPXL | 300 $EPXL |
| 50 | 1,000 $EPXL | 1,500 $EPXL |
| 100 | 1,000 $EPXL | 3,000 $EPXL |

By building a strong network of active players, you can create a sustainable passive income stream through the referral program.
