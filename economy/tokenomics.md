![Token Economy](https://placeholder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/placeholder.png)

## What is $EVER?

$EVER is the primary token used in Everpixel. It functions as both a utility token (for gameplay) and a reward token (earned from activities). $EVER exists on Base Chain.

## Token Earnings

Players can earn $EVER through:
- **Dungeon Rewards**: Primary earning method
- **Graveyard Staking**: Passive income from dead Heroes (20% of dungeon fees)
- **Referral Program**: 3% of referred players' $EVER spending

## Supply Control Mechanisms

### 1. Burn Mechanisms

$EVER features aggressive burning to control inflation:
- **Hero Mint**: $20 USDC from each $50 mint buys and burns $EVER from Uniswap pool
- **Dungeon Entry**: 75% of fees burned
- **Premium Features**: 80-85% of fees burned

### 2. Fee Distribution

- **Dungeon Entry**: 75% burned, 5% to treasury, 20% to Graveyard staking pool
- **Premium Features**: 80-85% burned, 15-20% to treasury

### 3. Locked Rewards

- Rewards earned from dungeons are initially locked
- Tokens unlock gradually by block number
- Prevents immediate selling and market flooding

### 4. Treasury Allocation

- 5% of dungeon entry fees go to treasury
- Supports long-term game development and economy management

### 5. Graveyard Staking Pool

- 20% of dungeon entry fees go to the Graveyard staking pool
- Distributed to dead Heroes based on their staking power
- Creates a sustainable passive income system

## Token Flow Visualization

The economy creates a sustainable loop where tokens flow from players to the system and back again in carefully controlled amounts. This balanced approach ensures that $EVER maintains value over time while rewarding active participants in the ecosystem.
