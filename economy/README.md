## Everpixel Economy at a Glance

Everpixel features a carefully balanced token economy designed for long-term sustainability. The game uses a single token ($EPXL) with multiple utility functions and aggressive burn mechanisms.

## Core Economic Principles

### 1. Single Token System

Everpixel uses **$EPXL** as its only token, serving as both:
- **Utility token** for in-game actions
- **Reward token** for successful gameplay

This unified approach simplifies the economy and creates natural supply-demand cycles.

### 2. Multiple Utility Uses

$EPXL has several vital uses in the game:

| Usage | Description | Burn Rate |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Dungeon Entry | Required to enter dungeons | 95% burned |
| Fatigue Recovery | Restore Hero energy | 100% burned |
| Level Acceleration | Speed up Hero development | 100% burned |
| Future: Marketplace | Trading fees | TBD |
| Future: Cosmetics | Visual enhancements | TBD |
| Future: DAO Voting | Governance power | No burn |

### 3. Value Generation

Players can earn $EPXL through:
- **Dungeon Rewards**: Main source of new tokens
- **Graveyard Staking**: Passive income from dead Heroes
- **Referral Program**: 1% of referred players' spending

### 4. Controlled Supply

The economy includes powerful mechanisms to control token supply:
- **Hero Minting**: 20 USDC from each mint buys and burns $EPXL
- **High Burn Rates**: 95-100% of spent tokens are burned
- **Locked Rewards**: Dungeon rewards unlock gradually
- **Treasury**: 5% of dungeon fees fund development

## Economic Flow

The economic flow creates a balanced loop:
