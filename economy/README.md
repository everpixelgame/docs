## Everpixel Economy at a Glance

Everpixel features a carefully balanced token economy designed for long-term sustainability. The game uses a single token ($EPXL) with multiple utility functions and aggressive burn mechanisms.

## Core Economic Principles

### 1. Single Token System

Everpixel uses **$EPXL** as its only token, serving as both:
- **Utility token** for in-game actions
- **Reward token** for successful gameplay

This unified approach simplifies the economy and creates natural supply-demand cycles.

### 2. Multiple Utility Uses

$EPXL has several vital uses in the game:

| Usage | Description | Burn Rate | Treasury | Graveyard |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Dungeon Entry | Required to enter dungeons | 75% burned | 5% | 20% |
| Premium Features | XP accelerators, death protection | 80-85% burned | 15-20% | 0% |
| Future: Marketplace | Trading fees | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Future: Cosmetics | Visual enhancements | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Future: DAO Voting | Governance power | No burn | N/A | N/A |

### 3. Value Generation

Players can earn $EPXL through:
- **Dungeon Rewards**: Main source of new tokens
- **Graveyard Staking**: Passive income from dead Heroes through direct pool distribution (20% of dungeon fees)
- **Referral Program**: 3% of referred players' spending

### 4. Controlled Supply

The economy includes powerful mechanisms to control token supply:
- **Hero Minting**: $20 USDC from each $50 mint buys and burns $EPXL from Uniswap pool
- **High Burn Rates**: 75% of dungeon fees are burned
- **Locked Rewards**: Dungeon rewards unlock gradually
- **Treasury**: 5% of fees go to treasury for ongoing development
- **Graveyard Staking**: 20% of dungeon fees go to the Graveyard staking pool

## Economic Flow

The economic flow creates a balanced loop of earning and burning, ensuring long-term sustainability for the game ecosystem. For more detailed information, check out our [Tokenomics](tokenomics.md) and [Referral System](referrals.md) pages.
